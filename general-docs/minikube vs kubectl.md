# 🧩 Minikube vs. kubectl – What’s the Difference?

## 📜 Overview

| Tool         | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minikube** | A tool to **set up and manage a local Kubernetes cluster**. It runs a **single-node Kubernetes cluster** inside a VM or container. |
| **kubectl**  | The **Kubernetes command-line tool** to **interact with Kubernetes clusters** (including the one Minikube sets up).                |

## 🧪 Minikube Commands

Minikube is used to:

* Start, stop, delete local clusters
* Manage Kubernetes context
* Access services locally
* Interact with cluster-specific settings

### 🛠️ Common Minikube Commands

```bash
minikube start                # Start the local Kubernetes cluster
minikube stop                 # Stop the cluster
minikube delete               # Delete the cluster
minikube status               # Show status of the cluster
minikube dashboard            # Launch the Kubernetes dashboard UI
minikube service <svc-name>   # Open the URL for a NodePort service
minikube docker-env           # Show Docker env for the minikube VM
```

## ⚙️ kubectl Commands

`kubectl` is used to:

* Create, inspect, and manage **Kubernetes resources**
* Apply YAML files for **Deployment, Service, ConfigMap**, etc.
* Debug and monitor resources (pods, nodes, events)

### ⚡ Common kubectl Commands

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml    # Apply a manifest file
kubectl get pods                    # List all pods
kubectl get svc                     # List all services
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>     # View detailed info about a pod
kubectl logs <pod-name>             # View logs from a pod
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml   # Delete resources defined in YAML
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- bash      # Open a terminal in a running pod
```

## 🔍 Summary Table

| Feature           | `minikube`                                 | `kubectl`                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Scope             | Cluster management                         | Resource management                        |
| Operates on       | Local machine (Minikube cluster)           | Any configured Kubernetes cluster          |
| Setup requirement | Installs and starts K8s locally            | Requires a running cluster (like Minikube) |
| Used for          | Starting/stopping K8s, accessing services  | Creating/managing pods, services, etc.     |
| Examples          | `minikube start`, `minikube service <svc>` | `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl apply -f`     |

## 💡 Key Takeaway

* 🧱 **Minikube** is like your **local cluster builder and controller**.
* 🧰 **kubectl** is your **cluster operator's command tool** for managing K8s objects inside any cluster.
